# üíºpersonal portfolio

Welcome to my Portfolioüë©üèª‚Äçüíª, a comprehensive showcase of my work and skills. This portfolio is a single-page application built using React and Node.js, featuring a polished user interface with engaging animations. The portfolio is divided into four main sections: About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resum√©.

Upon opening the application, you're greeted with the About Me section, providing a brief introduction and highlighting my professional journey. The Portfolio section showcases my work samples, demonstrating my experience and proficiency in building single-page applications. The Contact section offers a direct line of communication through a form, and the Resum√© section includes a downloadable copy of my resum√© for further details about my qualifications.

This portfolio serves as a testament to my skills and capabilities, providing potential employers with a comprehensive platform to assess my fit for their open positions.

The portfolio is built using React.js for building the user interface, along with additional libraries such as AOS, Tailwind, and SweetAlert2 to enhance the front-end interactions. React Router is used for seamless navigation within the single-page application. 

The application also includes the ability to view PDFs using the React-PDF library. The project is set up with Vite, which provides a faster and leaner development experience. 

The application is deployed on Netlify, offering a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for visitors to navigate through this project.
